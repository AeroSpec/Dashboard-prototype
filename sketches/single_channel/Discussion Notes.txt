Discussion on sketches

Need to de-emphasize low measurements
- via scale
	- Log scale emphasizes low measurements
	- power scale de-emphasizes low measurements
	- concern about interpretation / skew / BYOC <- bring your own calculator
	- "log" and "power" name might be a turn-off for some users
	- terminology needs to be approachable
	- tooltips about the actual tool? i.e. explanations about the interface details given somewhere
- excluding low measurements - seems undesirable
- blend into background via colors or transparency factor
	- use of light gray rather than green for low measurements?

Also likely need to de-emphasize old / stale measurements
- right-handed scale bar
- "fade-away" time-series via transparency?
- color map near scale bar
- exponentially weighted averages applied visually
	- pandas.DataFrame.ewm

Summarize time-integrated values via histogram
- left side of time series (vertical), splits on threshold #
- stacked histogram to show sum(measurements) & breakdown
- over different time ranges
	- any splits? e.g. on threshold
	- over-laid box-plot
- summarize via pie-chart! **

Color options:
- color lines/points vs. color background??
- 2 vs 3 vs 4 vs continuous?
- any standards on color? (purple = hazardous)
- Good, moderate, unhealthy, hazardous
- colorblind option

Current time
- Display somewhere
- Analog vs Digital?
- Fixed location for all views/tabs?

Dropdown vs. button selectors?

Multiple levels of summary:
Per sensor per category
- highest level - 1 color = current value
- next level - several key statistics
- next level - time-series + extra stats
- lowest level - all stats/views/categories for a given sensor
Per facility:
- 1 color = current average or peak value, # sensors online, warnings
- map / list 
- sensor views

Display of interdependencies / relationships between categories?
- correlation heatmap?
- correlation between sensors? **

Are these of interest to the user:
- Future forecasting?
- Proportion of PM by particle size?
- Dashboard customizability?

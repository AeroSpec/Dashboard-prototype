### Project summary
[AeroSpec](https://www.aerospec.io/) is a UW-based startup which designs and calibrates sensors to measure local air quality, noise, temperature, and other environmental data in real time. This product allows users in commercial and industrial settings to effectively manage environmental hazards, mitigate the health impacts of these factors, and maintain the safety of their facilities. Our project goal was to create a data visualization concept and prototype for AeroSpecâ€™s user interface. The aim was to display the data collected by sensors to users in a clear and interpretable way, leveraging effective visual design principles. We produced a visualization dashboard to be utilized in upcoming product demos and pilot studies in dental offices and manufacturing plants.


### Data
Data currently visible in the dashboard was obtained from pilot studies, which were sampled and used to generate a new dataset simulating the collection of data in real time. The method used to create this dataset is described at data/InterestingWF/INFO.txt.
